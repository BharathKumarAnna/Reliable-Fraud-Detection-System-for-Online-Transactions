# 🛡️ Reliable Fraud Detection System Dashboard

A full-stack Python-based web dashboard that monitors transactions and system reliability metrics for an online fraud detection system.
Built using **Flask**, **MySQL**, and **Docker**, the system tracks fraudulent activities and software reliability indicators such as MTBF, MTTR, Error Rate, and Availability.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Real-time dashboard for:
  - Total Transactions
  - Fraudulent Transactions
  - Error Rate (%)
  - Health Checks
  - System Reliability Metrics
- 🔐 Rule-based fraud detection logic with extensible ML support
- 🗃️ SQL Database-backed transaction and metric storage
- 🐳 Docker-ready deployment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer           | Technology            |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Backend          | Python (Flask)         |
| Database         | MySQL                  |
| ORM              | SQLAlchemy             |
| Monitoring       | SQL-based metrics      |
| Containerization | Docker, Docker Compose |

## 🧱 SQL Schema Overview

### Tables:
- **Users** - Stores registered user data
- **Transactions** - Logs every user transaction
- **FraudAlerts** - Flags suspicious or fraudulent activity
- **Metrics** - Tracks software reliability indicators
- **HealthChecks** - Stores uptime and response time data

## 📈 Software Reliability Metrics Tracked

| Metric     | Description                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **MTBF**   | Mean Time Between Failures                 |
| **MTTR**   | Mean Time To Recovery                      |
| **Error Rate** | % of failed transactions              |
| **Availability** | (Uptime / Total Time) × 100        |
| **Latency** | Time for fraud check and transactions     |
| **Accuracy** | Precision & recall of fraud detection    |

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reliable-fraud-detection-dashboard.git
cd reliable-fraud-detection-dashboard
```

### 2. Setup MySQL

Edit your `.env` or update `DATABASE_URL` in `app.py`:

```
mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/fraud_detection
```

Make sure MySQL and the `pymysql` driver are installed.

### 3. Initialize Database

Use the provided SQL schema or ORM models to create tables.

### 4. Run Flask App

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- MySQL database
- Flask-based fraud detection service
